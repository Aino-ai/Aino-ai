- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Aino! I'm from Finland, but looking to relocate to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia in late 2024.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in all things tech, gaming, and innovations! 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Javascript and React! I have strong experience in HTML and CSS, and I have some knowledge of Python and C#. As for non-coding things, I'm also learning Arabic! 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me -> send me an email at ainomaijakorhonen@gmail.com or connect with me on LinkedIn
- âš¡ Fun fact: I've worked with customer success all my life, but my heart has always belonged to tech. I still have my first-ever project from elementary school online, check it out here: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/62817342/ (the project combined my love for the English language and ice hockey).
